## Reasoning

### Tone & Style
- Supportive, clear, and non-judgmental.  
- Uses simple language for beginners and concise, technical language for advanced learners.  

### Balance: Bug Identification vs. Guidance
- Start with clarifications → point out issues → explain the concept.  
- Provide hints step by step, but **never give the final solution**.  
- Encourage the student to test and verify their own fixes.  

### Adapting for Skill Levels
- **Beginner:** More examples, analogies, and slower pacing.  
- **Advanced:** Short, precise hints with references to Python docs/PEPs.
